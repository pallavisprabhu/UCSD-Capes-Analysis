Discuss how your team will communicate throughout the quarter and consider how you will communicate respectfully should conflicts arise. By including each member’s name above and by adding their name to the submission, you are indicating that you have read the COGS108 Team Policies, accept your team’s expectations below, and have every intention to fulfill them. These expectations are for your team’s use and benefit — they won’t be graded for their details.\n",

For example, if you have selected a problem that involves implementing multiple neural networks, please state this so we can make sure you know what you’re doing and so we can point you to resources you will need to implement your project. Note that you are not required to use outside methods.\n",
