    "CAPES stands for “Course And Professor Evaluations” and are offered to students at the end of every quarter to give feedback on their courses and the professors that taught them. As stated on the website, CAPES<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) is: \n",
    "\n",
    "    “a student-run organization that administers a standardized evaluation of UCSD's undergraduate courses and professors. Student feedback gauges the caliber of both the University's curriculum and its faculty. We provide students with the opinions of their peers on any particular course or professor.” (UCSD)\n",
    "    \n",
    "After students submit their CAPES, this data is aggregated for each quarter of evaluations into features like the percentage of students that recommended the class, the percentage of students that recommend the instructor, the number of hours per week involved in this class, the average grade expected, and the average grade received (which is calculated from the final submitted grades). CAPEs play an important role in helping students choose their professors and even the courses they enroll them in as they generally have more statistics and comprehensive data compared to other rating sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, other rating sites often show signs of significant skew, with a majority of ratings being either towards the extreme since people are more likely to rate something they have a strong reaction towards. This creates a bimodal distribution that lacks data in between these two strong opinions. On the other hand, while not entirely protected, CAPEs likely have some resistance to potential skews in data since students are often incentivized to complete them for extra credit, which gives equal opportunity for various kinds of responses.\n",
    "In winter of 2021, a COGS108 group also asked a question regarding CAPEs: “How has remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic affected UCSD students’ grades and learning experience?” (Group084_Wi21<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)). Thus, while the general topic remains the same, while they focus on the change of grades and learning as a result of the pandemic, we want to explore the potential association between students’ like of professors (recommended professor) and their potential overestimation/underestimation of their performance in class. While it seems obvious that students who do better in a course likely recommend a professor at a higher rate than those who don’t, we are more interested in their confidence and expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, prior studies that have explored this topic of student-professor evaluations have found evidence of gender bias where female professors tended to rank lower than their male counterparts<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). While this is not directly related to our question, the general idea remains the same and it peaked our curiousity on some of the other featurs we could include. This could also be an interesting feature to consider in our analysis: how the professors’ gender, likeability, and the students' expectation of grade vs their actual received grade are all related. Do students overestimate their ability and expect a higher grade when the professor is female? How does the gender of a professor play into their recommendation in relation to the grades received in the class? Some other features that pique interest are the difference in expectation vs received depending on the department or type of class (like STEM vs liberal arts). Based on experience and expectatioon, STEM classes are notoriously perceived as more difficult than liberal arts class. Thus, it may be interesting to explore how this perceived difficulty plays into the relationship between the difference in grades expected and received and the overall likeabilty/recommendation of a professor. \n",

    "### Cleaning Data Process\n",
    "  - Dataset is relatively clean except for 'Average Grade Recieved' column containing some NaN. We determined that the data was in a usable format because each measured variable had its own column, each observation of the measured variable was in a different row, and the column headers are descriptive of their variables.\n",
    "  - We first decided to drop the evaluation url column since we did not deem it as relevant information needed to answer our question.\n",
    "  - We then checked and dropped all rows with null information since we felt those with missing values would not be helpful and would make exctracting data more difficult.\n",
    "  - We created a standarisation function that would convert all of the values in the 'Average Grade Expected' and 'Average Grade Received' columns to float columns and remove the '%' symbol.\n",
    "  - A new column was created called 'Difference' where the difference between the 'Average Grade Received' and the 'Average Grade Expected' is stored. This will help later to determine whether students over or underestimated their grades.\n",
    "  - We created columns for both the year and quarters so it has integers representing the quarters (1 = Winter, 2 = Spring, 3 = S1, 4 = S2, 5 = S3, 6 = Fall, 7 = SU) and the full year is displayed.\n",
    "  - Lastly, we also the categories of 'liberal' and 'stem' for the top 100 class codes for which information could be found in order to use these two groups in our analysis.\n"
