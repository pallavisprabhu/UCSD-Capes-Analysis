Discuss how your team will communicate throughout the quarter and consider how you will communicate respectfully should conflicts arise. By including each memberâ€™s name above and by adding their name to the submission, you are indicating that you have read the COGS108 Team Policies, accept your teamâ€™s expectations below, and have every intention to fulfill them. These expectations are for your teamâ€™s use and benefit â€” they wonâ€™t be graded for their details.\n",

For example, if you have selected a problem that involves implementing multiple neural networks, please state this so we can make sure you know what youâ€™re doing and so we can point you to resources you will need to implement your project. Note that you are not required to use outside methods.\n",
